# Linguistic Arousal, Emotional Tone, and Sharing Behaviors

**This is my (Arden's) repo for the mindcore summer '23 project:** *Linguistic Arousal, Emotional Tone, and Sharing Behaviors***.** Here is a link to my entire [preregistration](https://osf.io/registries/my-registrations?tab=submitted&view_only=)

My project explores the following research hypotheses:

## Hypothesis 1:

> **A within-person**: Individuals will be more motivated to share articles when the arousal of their responses to the articles (i.e., written comments) is higher compared to their average response.
>
> B between-people: People whose responses have higher arousal (compared to other people) will have higher motivations to share

## Hypothesis 2:

> **A within-person**: Individuals will be more motivated to share articles when the tone of their responses to the articles (i.e., written comments) is more positive compared to their average response.
>
> B between-people: People whose responses have a more positive tone (compared to other people) will have higher intentions to share.

## File/folder breakdown

### Data

> contains all the datasets necessary to complete the analyses. We segmented the articles we fed t0 GPT into 5 different pieces

### Examples

> contains the csvs we fed `GPT` to finetune the model to complete our task.

### tone_results

> has `GPT` output from the five segmented files. filename includes the model name and temp we used (0.01).

### gpt-arousal-tone-pipeline-FINAL.ipynb

> the classifier we fine-tuned to conduct our text analysis task.

### Analyses

> coming soon!
